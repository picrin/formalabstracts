# Formal abstracts

A repository of formalized statements proved in mathematical research papers.

This repository is part of the *Formal abstracts* projects initiated by [Thomas Hales](https://sites.google.com/site/thalespitt/).

## How to get involved

We welcome contributions from all interested individuals. Each formal abstract (fabstract) is written in [lean](http://leanprover.github.io/documentation/), an open source theorem prover, and resides in `fabstracts` directory. Submission guidelines [are available](fabstract/README.markdown). A small, self-contained example is the statement of [Fermat's Last Theorem](fabstract/WilesA_and_Taylor_R_FermatLast)

Participants of the project are encouraged to join [the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/formalabstracts).
